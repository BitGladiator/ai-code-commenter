Additional notes:
- Running this script prints the 10 Fibonacci numbers: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 (each on its own line), followed by "True".
- Complexity:
  - fibonacci: O(n) time, O(1) extra space (it prints values rather than storing them).
  - is_prime: O(sqrt(num)) time in the worst case.
- Possible improvements:
  - Have fibonacci return a list of values instead of printing, making it more reusable.
  - Add input validation (e.g., ensure n is a non-negative integer).
  - For large primes, use more advanced primality tests (Millerâ€“Rabin) or optimizations (skip even divisors).
  - Add docstrings and type hints for clarity.
