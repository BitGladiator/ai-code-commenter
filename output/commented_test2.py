# This script prints a simple greeting to the program's standard output (stdout).
# The next line is the original program line and is preserved exactly as requested.
print('Hello')
# The print() call above is a call to Python's built-in function that writes its
# arguments to standard output. Here a single argument is provided: a string
# literal 'Hello' enclosed in single quotes.
# By default print() converts its arguments to strings (no conversion needed here)
# and writes them followed by a newline character, so 'Hello' will appear on its
# own line. After this statement executes the script has no further statements
# and will terminate.
